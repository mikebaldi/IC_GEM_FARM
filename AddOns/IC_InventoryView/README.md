# InventoryView
## Description:
This AddOn will load all buffs from the inventory and show their ID, name, and count. BrivGemFarm will update this automatically on every reset and add change and per run values as well.

>**Note:** Buffs include potions and scrolls but does not include chests.

## View Chests:

This button will load all of your currently owned chests into the list view. If BrivGemFarm is running it will be replaced by the inventory on every reset, so it is not recommended to use while BrivGemFarm is running.
