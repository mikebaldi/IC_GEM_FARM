# ChestPurchaser
## Description:
This Addon allows for purchasing and opening of chests.

> **Note:** Note: This script is only minimally functional. 
#
## Instructions:
Instructions:
1. Either load the game before running the script, or after the game is running press the refresh button next to the buy chests dropdown box.
2. Once the dropdown box has filled with the list of chests, select one from the list. (Typing the chest's ID number is okay too *as long as the list has been loaded and the game has not been restarted since the last list refresh*).
3. Type the number of chests you wish to purchase in the box next to the buy button.
4. Click buy.

Opening chests is done in the same way, except from within the open chests box.

Notes:

1. Even though the game must be open to get the information necessary (e.g. userid and hash) to select chests and make server calls, the game should be closed to do the actual opening and buying chests. This is cumbersome, but it's how it works for now.
2. All chests in game are listed and there is no filter for finding the chest you want. 
3. Chests that are not purchasable are listed in the buy chests drop down. There is currently no way to filter them.
