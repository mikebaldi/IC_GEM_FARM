# A Gem Farmer's Guide to Champions
## Important champions
In alphabetical order

### `Deekin` (Slot 1)

`Deekin` will increase the spawn speed through the "Boss wants speed" specialisation. 

Performs the same task as Widdle.

Use the better geared champion you have between Deekin and Widdle.

Pick the right-hand spec.

Recommendation: **Highly recommended**

### `Widdle` (Slot 2)

`Widdle` increases the spawn rate of mobs. Useful to a certain degree and worth a spot in your Gem Farm. A better scaling version of Deekin.

Use the better geared champion you have between Widdle and Deekin.

Pick the middle spec.

Recommendations: **Highly recommended**

### `Sentry` (Slot 4)

`Sentry` has an ability that has a chance to lower the requirements of the next zone when she is not attacked in the previous zone.

Pick the middle spec.

Recommendation: **Useful when Hew is not 1-kill zone completion**

### `Shandie` (Slot 6)

`Shandie` is really useful for the Gem Farm as she acts like a free speed pot once Dash is up and running, which takes 60 seconds. 

Pick the left-hand spec.

Recommendation: **Strongly recommended**

### `Hew Maan` (Slot 8)

`Hew Maan` is also a strongly recommended champion. Their ability to massively increase the number of quest rewards you gain per kill is the reason why Gem Farms can get very fast.

If you're serious about your gem farming, you'll want to get Hew to as close to zone completion with 1 kill as you can. Sentry can help out here.

Pick the right-hand spec.

Recommendation: **Strongly recommended**

### `Havilar` (Slot 10)

`Havilar` will increase the quest rewards gained when killing imps. This makes her useful for specific adventures where you don't already have a 1-kill Hew, such as "Cursed Farmer".

Recommendation: **Situational**

## Other notable champions (or classes of champions)
### Gold find champions

Gold find champions are important in some Gem Farms. Eventually your limiting factor will become the amount of stacks `Briv` can achieve in one client restart. 

It can be useful to increase the distance your Gem Farm can run for before hitting the Click Wall and that's where Gold find champions come in.

This is just a list of Gold farm champions:

* `Jarlaxle` - Slot 4 - Has a solid 50% gold find feat.
* `Ellywick` - Slot 10 - Increases gold find when you use her right-hand spec.
* `Rust` - Slot 11 - Good when you have the right-hand spec, and no familiar on his Ultimate ability, as long as Rust manages to pick up his gold coin during your run. This RNG aspect may put some people off.
* `Azaka` - Slot 12 - Her Ultimate ability will summon a pair of tigers that cause mobs to drop gold with each attack when you use her right-hand spec. 

### Health-share tanks

Health-share tanks can be useful to drop into the W formation in order to bolster `Briv`'s tanking capability, which in turn will increase the number of Steelbone stacks you get when offline stacking. 

Use this method with caution as unexpected synergy can suddenly cause the offline calculation to decide you killed everything in the zone rather than tanked for stacks.

A health-share tank or two is usually okay though.

* `Aila` - Slot 9
* `Dragonbait` - Slot 11
* `Gromma` - Slot 3
* `Havilar` - Slot 10
* `Nayeli` - Slot 3
* `Nova` - Slot 11
* `Selise` - Slot 12
* `Tyril` - Slot 10
* `Wulfgar` - Slot 10

I have not included `Sgt. Knox` due to being in Slot 6. If you're Gem Farming, slot 6 will be guaranteed for Shandie (and if you don't yet have Shandie, timegate her ASAP).
