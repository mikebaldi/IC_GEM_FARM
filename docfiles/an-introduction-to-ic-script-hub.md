# Exploring IC Script Hub
## Overview

Now we dig into what is available within `IC Script Hub`. 

The old ModronGui script did one thing: It automated gem farms within Idle Champions.

`IC Script Hub` contains many scripts. At present the two main functions of the software are to present a central location for a complete rewrite of the functionality that was in ModronGui along with an implementation of a Jimothy script.

## Gem farm? Jimothy? What the hell?

This is as good a moment as any to briefly explain what these are:

### Gem farm

A Gem Farm in `Idle Champions` involves using abilities belonging to certain champions in order to massively speed up (and automate) the aquisition of many, many gems in order to improve your champions. 

The two champions required by this Gem Farm script are Briv and Shandie. Hew is also strongly recommended. 

You are also recommended to have an automatable Fast Modron Core. This is obtained by completing the Split the Party 2 variant within the game (by having at least 3 champions in every bench slot) and levelling it up to level 3.

You build three formations and put them into the starred formations available within Idle Champions (which can be recalled via the hotkeys, Q, W, and E). 

The script then automates the progression through many, many modron core resets performing the actions needed to keep Briv in sprint stacks, and Shandie at full dash, all while ensuring the run doesn't get stuck.

The primary aim of the gem farm script is to automate farming gems that you use to increase your champion power by accumulating gems for a specific goal. 

You can set the script to buy either silver or gold chests as you stack Briv for the next run.

### Jimothy

Jimothy is a way to push your party to very high levels (up to the max of 2001) in order to obtain favour needed to increase your party's gold find levels. A higher favour/gold find level allows you to script Gem Farms that run for longer.

Jimothy requires Briv (at least 100% 1 skip as you must be able to skip bosses), along with a high level Hew that is preferably 2 kill for the number of adjacencies in the zone you wish to Jimothy. 

It is possible with a lower level Hew, but it gets annoying.

You also need Jim. 

You will set up a Q formation that has at least Briv, Hew, and Jim in it. You will set up an E formation that has everyone in Q apart from Briv. 

I recommend filling up the remaining slots in the party with multihitters or other beneficial champions.

The primary aim of the Jimothy script is to automated getting up to a level where you can farm meaningful favour.

It's usually followed by an Azaka farm on the highest melee boss in the adventure.

## What's your poison?

It's time to decide now you know what the two main scripts in `IC Script Hub` do.
